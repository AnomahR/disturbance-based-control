	abstract = {Over the last 50 years a steady stream of accounts have been written on the separation principle of stochastic control. Even in the context of the linear-quadratic regulator in continuous time with Gaussian white noise, subtle difficulties arise, unexpected by many, that are often overlooked. In this paper we propose a new framework for establishing the separation principle. This approach takes the viewpoint that stochastic systems are well-defined maps between sample paths rather than stochastic processes per se and allows us to extend the separation principle to systems driven by martingales with possible jumps. While the approach is more in line with "real-life" engineering thinking where signals travel around the feedback loop, it is unconventional from a probabilistic point of view in that control laws for which the feedback equations are satisfied almost surely, and not deterministically for every sample path, are excluded.},

	abstract = {We prove characterizations of input-to-state stability (ISS) for a large class of infinite-dimensional control systems, including some classes of evolution equations over Banach spaces, time-delay systems, ordinary differential equations (ODE), switched systems. These characterizations generalize well-known criteria of ISS, proved by Sontag and Wang for ODE systems. For the special case of differential equations in Banach spaces we prove even broader criteria for ISS and apply these results to show that (under some mild restrictions) the existence of a non-coercive ISS Lyapunov functions implies ISS. We introduce the new notion of strong ISS which is equivalent to ISS in the ODE case, but which is strictly weaker than ISS in the infinite-dimensional setting and prove several criteria for the sISS property. At the same time, we show by means of counterexamples, that many characterizations, which are valid in the ODE case, are not true for general infinite-dimensional systems.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00302},
	abstract = {We consider a system of linear hyperbolic PDEs where the state at one of the boundary points is controlled using the measurements of another boundary point. Because of the disturbances in the measurement, the problem of designing dynamic controllers is considered so that the closed-loop system is robust with respect to measurement errors. Assuming that the disturbance is a locally essentially bounded measurable function of time, we derive a disturbance-to-state estimate which provides an upper bound on the maximum norm of the state (with respect to the spatial variable) at each time in terms of  ∞ {\textbackslash}mathcalL{\textasciicircum}ınfty -norm of the disturbance up to that time. The analysis is based on constructing a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop system, which leads to controller synthesis and the conditions on system dynamics required for stability. As an application of this stability notion, the problem of quantized control for hyperbolic PDEs is considered where the measurements sent to the controller are communicated using a quantizer of finite length. The presence of quantizer yields practical stability only, and the ultimate bounds on the norm of the state trajectory are also derived.},

During the past decade there has been an accelerating interest in the de velopment of numerical methods for stochastic differential equations (SDEs). This activity has been as strong in the engineering and physical sciences as it has in mathematics, resulting inevitably in some duplication of effort due to an unfamiliarity with the developments in other disciplines. Much of the reported work has been motivated by the need to solve particular types of problems, for which, even more so than in the deterministic context, specific methods are required. The treatment has often been heuristic and ad hoc in character. Nevertheless, there are underlying principles present in many of the papers, an understanding of which will enable one to develop or apply appropriate numerical schemes for particular problems or classes of problems.},

This material has been used by the authors for one semester graduate-level courses at Brown University and the University of Kentucky. The simplest problem in calculus of variations is taken as the point of departure, in Chapter I. Chapters II, III, and IV deal with necessary conditions for an opti mum, existence and regularity theorems for optimal controls, and the method of dynamic programming. The beginning reader may find it useful first to learn the main results, corollaries, and examples. These tend to be found in the earlier parts of each chapter. We have deliberately postponed some difficult technical proofs to later parts of these chapters. In the second part of the book we give an introduction to stochastic optimal control for Markov diffusion processes. Our treatment follows the dynamic pro gramming method, and depends on the intimate relationship between second order partial differential equations of parabolic type and stochastic differential equations. This relationship is reviewed in Chapter V, which may be read inde pendently of Chapters I-IV. Chapter VI is based to a considerable extent on the authors' work in stochastic control since 1961. It also includes two other topics important for applications, namely, the solution to the stochastic linear regulator and the separation principle.},

A significant feature of the book is a unique and beautiful treatment of processes with independent increments, which assumes no prior knowledge of the theory of infinitely divisible laws. A wealth of results, ideas and techniques distinguish this text, one of the first to survey in a rigorous way the more modern results in the theory of stochastic processes and to link them to earlier developments in the subject.

For the 6th edition the author has added further exercises and, for the first time, solutions to many of the exercises are provided. Apart from several minor corrections and improvements, based on useful comments from readers and experts, the most important change in the corrected 5th printing of the 6th edition is in Theorem 10.1.9, where the proof of part b has been corrected and rewritten.

We assume the famil iarity with rings usually acquired in standard undergraduate algebra courses. Our general approach is categorical rather than arithmetical. The continuing theme of the text is the study of the relationship between the one-sided ideal structure that a ring may possess and the behavior of its categories of modules. Following a brief outline of set-theoretic and categorical foundations, the text begins with the basic definitions and properties of rings, modules and homomorphisms and ranges through comprehensive treatments of direct sums, finiteness conditions, the Wedderburn-Art in Theorem, the Jacobson radical, the hom and tensor functions, Morita equivalence and duality, de composition theory of injective and projective modules, and semiperfect and perfect rings. Both to illustrate the text and to extend it we have included a substantial number of exercises covering a wide spectrum of difficulty. There are, of course, many important areas of ring and module theory that the text does not touch upon. For example, we have made no attempt to cover such subjects as homology, rings of quotients, or commutative ring theory.},

The answer is simple: I did not learn about it until it was too late! My writing project in ring theory started in 1983 after I taught a year-long course in the subject at Berkeley. My original plan was to write up my lectures and publish them as a graduate text in a couple of years. My hopes of carrying out this plan on schedule were, however, quickly dashed as I began to realize how much material was at hand and how little time I had at my disposal. As the years went by, I added further material to my notes, and used them to teach different versions of the course. Eventually, I came to the realization that writing a single volume would not fully accomplish my original goal of giving a comprehensive treatment of basic ring theory. At the suggestion of Ulrike Schmickler-Hirzebruch, then Mathematics Editor of Springer-Verlag, I completed the first part of my project and published the write up in 1991 as A First Course in Noncommutative Rings, GTM 131, hereafter referred to as First Course (or simply FC).},

Starting from the definition of Gaussian measures in Hilbert spaces, concepts such as the Cameron-Martin formula, Brownian motion and Wiener integral are introduced in a simple way. These concepts are then used to illustrate some basic stochastic dynamical systems (including dissipative nonlinearities) and Markov semi-groups, paying special attention to their long-time behavior: ergodicity, invariant measure. Here fundamental results like the theorems of Prokhorov, Von Neumann, Krylov-Bogoliubov and Khas'minski are proved. The last chapter is devoted to gradient systems and their asymptotic behavior.},

	abstract = {It has been 15 years since the first edition of Stochastic Integration and Differential Equations, A New Approach appeared, and in those years many other texts on the same subject have been published, often with connections to applications, especially mathematical finance. Yet in spite of the apparent simplicity of approach, none of these books has used the functional analytic method of presenting semimartingales and stochastic integration. Thus a 2nd edition seems worthwhile and timely, though it is no longer appropriate to call it "a new approach".

The new edition has several significant changes, most prominently the addition of exercises for solution. These are intended to supplement the text, but lemmas needed in a proof are never relegated to the exercises. Many of the exercises have been tested by graduate students at Purdue and Cornell Universities. Chapter 3 has been completely redone, with a new, more intuitive and simultaneously elementary proof of the fundamental Doob-Meyer decomposition theorem, the more general version of the Girsanov theorem due to Lenglart, the Kazamaki-Novikov criteria for exponential local martingales to be martingales, and a modern treatment of compensators. Chapter 4 treats sigma martingales (important in finance theory) and gives a more comprehensive treatment of martingale representation, including both the Jacod-Yor theory and Emery’s examples of martingales that actually have martingale representation (thus going beyond the standard cases of Brownian motion and the compensated Poisson process). New topics added include an introduction to the theory of the expansion of filtrations, a treatment of the Fefferman martingale inequality, and that the dual space of the martingale space H{\textasciicircum}1 can be identified with BMO martingales. Solutions to selected exercises are available at the web site of the author, with current URL http://www.orie.cornell.edu/{\textasciitilde}protter/books.html.},

Yoshida established the characterization of generators of C0 semigroups in the 1940s, semigroups of linear operators and its neighboring areas have developed into a beautiful abstract theory. Moreover, the fact that mathematically this abstract theory has many direct and important applications in partial differential equations enhances its importance as a necessary discipline in both functional analysis and differential equations. In my opinion Pazy has done an outstanding job in presenting both the abstract theory and basic applications in a clear and interesting manner. The choice and order of the material, the clarity of the proofs, and the overall presentation make this an excellent place for both researchers and students to learn about C0 semigroups." \#Bulletin Applied Mathematical Sciences 4/85\#1 "In spite of the other monographs on the subject, the reviewer can recommend that of Pazy as being particularly written, with a bias noticeably different from that of the other volumes. Pazy's decision to give a connected account of the applications to partial differential equations in the last two chapters was a particularly happy one, since it enables one to see what the theory can achieve much better than would the insertion of occasional examples. The chapters achieve a very nice balance between being so easy as to appear disappointing, and so sophisticated that they are incomprehensible except to the expert." \#Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society\#2},

Abramovich and Aliprantis give a unique presentation that includes many new and recent advances in operator theory and brings together results that are spread over the vast literature. For instance, invariant subspaces of positive operators and the Daugavet equation are presented in monograph form for the first time. The authors keep the discussion self-contained and use exercises to achieve this goal. The book contains over 600 exercises to help students master the material developed in the text. The exercises are of varying degrees of difficulty and play an important and useful role in the presentation. They help to free the proofs of the main results of technical details, which are secondary to the principal ideas, but provide students with accurate and complete accounts of how such details ought to be worked out. The exercises also contain a considerable amount of additional material, and among them there are many well-known results whose proofs are not readily available elsewhere. Prerequisites are the standard introductory graduate courses in real analysis, general topology, measure theory, and functional analysis. The volume is suitable for graduate or advanced courses in operator theory, real analysis, integration theory, measure theory, function theory, and functional analysis. It will also be of great interest to researchers in mathematics, as well as in physics, economics, finance, engineering, and other related areas. The companion volume, Problems in Operator Theory, containing complete solutions to all exercises in An Invitation to Operator Theory, is available from the AMS as Volume 51 in the Graduate Studies in Mathematics series.},

These two parts can serve as a text on general state-space applied Markov chain theory. Although the choice of topics is quite different from what is usually covered, where most of the emphasis is put on countable state space, a graduate student should be able to read almost all these developments without any mathematical background deeper than that needed to study countable state space (very little measure theory is required).  Part III covers advanced topics on the theory of irreducible Markov chains. The emphasis is on geometric and subgeometric convergence rates and also on computable bounds.

MARKOV (1906-1907) on sequences of experiments "connected in a chain" and in the attempts to describe mathematically the physical phenomenon known as Brownian motion (L. BACHELlER 1900, A. EIN STEIN 1905). The first correct mathematical construction of a Markov process with continuous trajectories was given by N. WIENER in 1923. (This process is often called the Wiener process.) The general theory of Markov processes was developed in the 1930's and 1940's by A. N. KOL MOGOROV, W. FELLER, W. DOEBLlN, P. LEVY, J. L. DOOB, and others. During the past ten years the theory of Markov processes has entered a new period of intensive development. The methods of the theory of semigroups of linear operators made possible further progress in the classification of Markov processes by their infinitesimal characteristics. The broad classes of Markov processes with continuous trajectories be came the main object of study. The connections between Markov pro cesses and classical analysis were further developed. It has become possible not only to apply the results and methods of analysis to the problems of probability theory, but also to investigate analytic problems using probabilistic methods. Remarkable new connections between Markov processes and potential theory were revealed. The foundations of the theory were reviewed critically: the new concept of strong Markov process acquired for the whole theory of Markov processes great importance.},

This theorem provides us with a random substitute of linear algebra and hence can serve as the basis of a local theory of nonlinear random systems. In particular, global and local random invariant manifolds are constructed and their regularity is proved. Techniques for simplifying a system by random continuous or smooth coordinate tranformations are developed (random Hartman-Grobman theorem, random normal forms). Qualitative changes in families of random systems (random bifurcation theory) are also studied. A dynamical approach is proposed which is based on sign changes of Lyapunov exponents and which extends the traditional phenomenological approach based on the Fokker-Planck equation. Numerous instructive examples are treated analytically or numerically. The main intention is, however, to present a reliable and rather complete source of reference which lays the foundations for future works and applications.},

The second part of the text focuses on the ergodic theory of continuous transformations of compact metrizable spaces. The family of invariant probability measures for such a transformation is studied and related to properties of the transformation such as topological traitivity, minimality, the size of the non-wandering set, and existence of periodic points. Topological entropy is introduced and related to measure-theoretic entropy. Topological pressure and equilibrium states are discussed, and a proof is given of the variational principle that relates pressure to measure-theoretic entropies. Several examples are studied in detail. The final chapter outlines significant results and some applications of ergodic theory to other branches of mathematics.},

While basic analytic notions and results are reviewed in several appendices, more advanced operator theoretic topics are developed in detail, even beyond their immediate connection with ergodic theory. As a consequence, the book is also suitable for advanced or special-topic courses on functional analysis with applications to ergodic theory.Topics include:• an intuitive introduction to ergodic theory• an introduction to the basic notions, constructions, and standard examples of topological dynamical systems• Koopman operators, Banach lattices, lattice and algebra homomorphisms, and the Gelfand–Naimark theorem• measure-preserving dynamical systems• von Neumann’s Mean Ergodic Theorem and Birkhoff’s Pointwise Ergodic Theorem• strongly and weakly mixing systems• an examination of notions of isomorphism for measure-preserving systems• Markov operators, and the related concept of a factor of a measure preserving system• compact groups and semigroups, and a powerful tool in their study, the Jacobs–de Leeuw–Glicksberg decomposition• an introduction to the spectral theory of dynamical systems, the theorems of Furstenberg and Weiss on multiple recurrence, and applications of dynamical systems to combinatorics (theorems of van der Waerden, Gallai,and Hindman, Furstenberg’s Correspondence Principle, theorems of Roth and Furstenberg–Sárközy)Beyond its use in the classroom, Operator Theoretic Aspects of Ergodic Theory can serve as a valuable foundation for doing research at the intersection of ergodic theory and operator theory},

	abstract = {Random dynamical systems with Markovian coefficients allow two distinct ways of description. The description via the Markov semigroup is the classical one. More recently, the “dynamical systems ” or “ skew product flow ” representation has been introduced. In this paper, we take the point of view of the skew product flow, and try to retrieve some of the basic concepts dealt with by the Markov semi-group approach. We introduce a notion of Markov measures in terms of the skew product flow setting by requiring the joint process consisting of the system orbit together with the noise to be a Markov process. A more or less complete characterization of Markov measures is obtained by proving that these are functionals of the past of the system. This implies that invariant Markov measures are in a one to one correspondence with the invariant distributions for the Markov semi-group.},

However, existing DMD theory deals primarily with sequential time series for which the measurement dimension is much larger than the number of measurements taken. We present a theoretical framework in which we deﬁne DMD as the eigendecomposition of an approximating linear operator. This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential time series. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel sampling strategies that increase computational eﬃciency and mitigate the eﬀects of noise, respectively. We also introduce the concept of linear consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to rank-deﬁcient datasets, illustrating with examples. Such computations are not considered in the existing literature, but can be understood using our more general framework. In addition, we show that our theory strengthens the connections between DMD and Koopman operator theory. It also establishes connections between DMD and other techniques, including the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA), a system identiﬁcation method, and linear inverse modeling (LIM), a method from climate science. We show that under certain conditions, DMD is equivalent to LIM.},

	abstract = {Koopman and Perron–Frobenius operators are linear operators that encapsulate dynamics of nonlinear dynamical systems without loss of information. This is accomplished by embedding the dynamics into a larger inﬁnite-dimensional space where the focus of study is shifted from trajectory curves to measurement functions evaluated along trajectories and densities of trajectories evolving in time. Operator-theoretic approach to dynamics shares many features with an optimization technique: the Lasserre moment–sums-of-squares (SOS) hierarchies, which was developed for numerically solving non-convex optimization problems with semialgebraic data. This technique embeds the optimization problem into a larger primal semideﬁnite programming (SDP) problem consisting of measure optimization over the set of globally optimal solutions, where measures are manipulated through their truncated moment sequences. The dual SDP problem uses SOS representations to certify bounds on the global optimum. This workshop highlighted the common threads between the operator-theoretic dynamical systems and moment–SOS hierarchies in optimization and explored the future directions where the synergy of the two techniques could yield results in ﬂuid dynamics, control theory, optimization, and spectral theory.},

In particular, we establish a suﬃcient condition for integrability. We also introduce and study a class of semigroups on such dual pairs which are an abstract version of transition semigroups. Using our results, we give conditions ensuring that a semigroup consisting of kernel operators has a Laplace transform which also consists of kernel operators. We also provide conditions under which a semigroup is uniquely determined by its Laplace transform.},

	abstract = {We develop a new generalization of Koopman operator theory that incorporates the eﬀects of inputs and control. Koopman spectral analysis is a theoretical tool for the analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. Moreover, Koopman is intimately connected to dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), a method that discovers coherent, spatio-temporal modes from data, connects local-linear analysis to nonlinear operator theory, and importantly creates an equation-free architecture for the study of complex systems. For actuated systems, standard Koopman analysis and DMD are incapable of producing input-output models; moreover, the dynamics and the modes will be corrupted by external forcing. Our new theoretical developments extend Koopman operator theory to allow for systems with nonlinear input-output characteristics. We show how this generalization is rigorously connected to a recent development called dynamic mode decomposition with control. We demonstrate this new theory on nonlinear dynamical systems, including a standard susceptible-infectious-recovered model with relevance to the analysis of infectious disease data with mass vaccination (actuation).},
